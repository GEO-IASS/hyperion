Output of my PhD. It is a total mess, so no laughing. (PhDs do not lend themselves to neat code.) However, it contains some high end stereo algorithms, a shape from shading algorithm which is one of the best and some advanced light source estimation stuff. It does have a gui, Cyclops, which is an even more atrocious mess, and a pain to use. Also has lots of data massage tools to prepare data for the aforementioned algorithms, things such as rectification, calibration etc.

If you do make the mistake of looking through this code be warned that large chunks of it do not work, do strange things or otherwise are good cause to have me shot.

You can download binaries of Cyclops from my website, http://thaines.net
